                <h1>PART 1: Back in the Olden' Days of 2018...</h1>
                <p>
                    Working my way through highschool, I happened to find my passion for programming and ever since I have never gone a day without thinking about games, code or coding games.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After learning some basic Java and making a small text-based roll playing game <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">(can't find any pictures which is sad :( )</span> I felt comfortable enough 
                    to download Unity and attempt to make a roleplaying game. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enlisting the help of another student in my class that was just as passionate about RPGs we started work on our "Magnum Opus". This project was inspired by <i>Morrowind</i> which the both of us had recently 
                    discovered after becoming bored of <i>Skyrim</i>. There is not much of "Scrape" as it was called since we did not get far but it did plant a seed for us...
                </p>
                <br>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                    <img src="scrape1.jpg" style="height:30vh;">
                    <img src="scrape2.jpg" style="height:30vh;">
                    <img src="scrape3.jpg" style="height:30vh;">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Scrape was a na√Øve mess where movement was janky, the terrain was to large to accurately calculate lighting and we didn't know how to do skeletal animation so we resorted to dividing models into pieces 
                    and moving them instead in Unity's integrated animator. It was Hell and it wasn't long until we saw that we had no idea of what we were doing and the pure scale of the world we wanted.
                    Work slowed to a crawl until we finally just had to accept it, we would not be able to finish the game or even if we did it would be a buggy mess and that's not what we wanted Usurper to be known for...
                </p>
                <p>
                    This first iteration did lead to us working on distilling what the game was about because since we didn't write design documents we had to be accurately describing ideas to eachother to avoid misunderstandings.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div style="padding-left: 100px;">
                    <p>
                        <span style="color: rgb(68, 120, 187);">We wanted a non-linear RPG where the player was a member of a pantheon of gods but since you had apparently not done your duties, you were thrown out with the 
                        possibility of redeeming yourself by climbing the mountain and usurping a position from another member of the pantheon.</span>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After our defeat we talked about a healthier game to work on... We decided on a 2D RTS like <i>Age of Empires</i> or <i>Starcraft</i> and so in preparation I set out to learn how Unity handled 2D assets and got to work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>PART 2: A Dimensional Shift.</h1>
                <p>
                    Something I've learned about myself is that, given the ability, I will make something into either a roguelike or Usurper. This was suprisingly enough a mesh of the two and it all started from a simple experiment 
                    to learn terrain generation using perlin noise and Unity's tilemaps. I followed a couple of tutorials and finally had a terrain generator that I was reasonably proud of. This is where the mistake happened...
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I made the mistake of placing a 8x8 sprite on the screen and added the ability to move him in a grid-based fashion. My brain unfortunately immediatly clicked with this idea and I just thought that "This feels suprisingly
                     good to control!" and then I for some reason immediately started a new project and declared it "test_ultimalike_rpg" or in my brain "Usurper v2".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was without my partner's approval and so when he came to check on how I was doing, getting ready for the RTS he instead discovered me making Usurper from a scratch with a new art-style and now a 2d roguelite instead 
                    of the Bethesda copy we wanted from the beginning. Suprisingly enough he still wanted to work on it, the idea had perhaps stewed in his head like it had for me and so... We once again got to work!
                </p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                    <img src="usurp2_1.png" style="height:30vh;">
                    <img src="usurp2_2.png" style="height:30vh;">
                </div>
                <p>
                    The project once again underway, it got suprisingly far. There was a large world with support for buildings with multiple floors and a lot of other neat features. I reckon that the game was in a place where it was time to
                     actually time to take focus off adding features and actually creating content. There was a bit of an issue though...
                </p>
                <p>
                    My partner did not quite agree on the artstyle and wished to change it. I was totally for this decision because I believe that my friend had an idea in mind and so, he got to work. Progress was rather slow for both of us 
                    since neither of us are artists but bit by bit it started to take shape. After a while though something happened, a thing we can call <b>content creation miasma (CCM)</b>. Basically, adding content gets tiring after a while
                     and especially when you have a project as large as Usurper it takes the wind out of you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The progress slowed to a crawl and we both just kind of ended up stopping work on the project. It died a quiet death and in hindsight it was really stupid but I can also realize that the foundation wasn't really scalable.
                     It just didn't handle data in a way that would allow for a smooth playing experience and that is the tale of the second iteration.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>PART 3: A Lonesome Endeavor.</h1>
                <p>
                    The third iteration of Usurper is probably the one that got closest to an actual release considering that there is an actual itch.io page for it. But the reason why it <u>wasn't</u> finished is probably the one I feel the most pained about...
                </p>
                <center><iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/601233" height="167" width="800" frameborder="0"><a href="https://blindhatemachine.itch.io/usurper">De Arcane Mysterii: Usurper [DEAD] by Blind Hate Machine</a></iframe></center>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This iteration was done solo by myself, from what I remember this was just because I felt ashamed from forcing the second iteration onto my friend and so I wanted to finish the foundation this time then ask my friend if he was interested in working on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I even made some pretty decent cover art (in my opinion) that I sadly don't get to use (you can see it <a class="alt" href="gameCover600x900.png">here</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was this time a lot more modder-friendly with a lot of more modular systems (for example the scripting system and the items).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within a short while the game was in a really playable state, you could generate dungeons and explore them, use different items and magic. Basically the cool stuff was in. <br><br>
                    This time as well another part of the lore was actually solidified, this time the concept of the Judge. I loved the idea of the pantheon of gods that you would be the avatar of was guided by a figure, in this case it was the personification of the devs (me). After the last boss on a new game+ run the game would allow you to face the Judge and it would be an encounter where we would break every single rule of the game to show the power that the devs have over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Judge would be personified by a 3d model of a pulsating heart (the image of our logo at the time) and would for example, turn your screen completely black to blind you and invert your controls. The whole nine yards. It's actually really sad for me to talk about all this becuase of why this is not an actually finished product.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The death of this game was actually very quick this time around. So in my private time I have multiple times tried out different Linux distros (Solus, Pop OS, etc.). This time was no different since I found myself extremely bored at my parent's place during the summer break from uni. I was having a good time until I decided to try out working on the project via linux but! I had an external HDD for projects and personal files and I had accidentally installed the distro on that harddrive. This meant that ALL my projects at the time and ALL my personal pictures and stuff was just... gone... You can find the twitter thread from when it happened below.

                    I spent an hour trying to get my files back to no avail and I then spent another hour pacing around my room depressed about the work lost, I had so many ideas and quests I wanted to add and now I just... couldn't. After some time though I felt as though it was a sign to just do it over again with a better foundation once again since in this iteration the ENTIRE map was loaded in at all time (ouch).
                </p>
                <p>
                    That same day I had already started on the fourth iteration and thus, the third iteration died but it will always serve as a lesson in being attentive around what you're doing with data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>PART 4: A Complicated Complication.</h1>
                <p>
                    This fourth iteration is a technical mess and proved to me at the time that I had WAYS to go as a programmer. The most important thing I learnt is that you should actually take time to consider what you're actually putting into your codebase. You can actually find the github for it (<a class="alt" href="https://github.com/Momonyaro/Usurper">here</a>).
                </p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                    <img src="EavE1d8WAAAui4Y.jfif" style="height:30vh;">
                    <img src="EbCMibSWsAAmxfM.jfif" style="height:30vh;">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Okay so picture this. Your last really ambitious game just got Thanos snapped and so what do you do? Well for me it was to make the same game again but make it infinitely more complicated. I know it sounds super smart but the idea this time around was, instead of just making a really moddable game, how about we make a toolkit a la the Creation Engine and allow people to make the game I couldn't make instead? It sounds really stupid in hindsight and yeah, it was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It started simple, just a simple tile-renderer since that was the main issue plagueing the third iteration and within a day, it worked. It read in external sprites, it allowed for per-tile coloring and lighting and it was really nice! From there it was a matter of re-introducing all the things from the third iteration but also adding a layer on top where in the editor you could add, remove and change all these things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second thing I added to the renderer was maps and map-editing along with things like a tile-atlas where you could say if a tile was: a collider, a lightSource or transparent. Again this seemed fine so I went on to add the lighting and entities. All was good in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dungeons like the general map-editing was rather nice to add since I could modularly add different generation algorithms. Also it was time to add some more... Specific features. The first one was items and item categories where you could define an item category and the properties they all share and then create individual items that use the shared properties. On top of this I also had to do the same for entities where an entity was a certain species that could have differing body-parts and also faction ties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So by now you can see where this is going but this was still the easier parts. The next thing to obviously add was a custom programming language for internal events. Yeah so I don't really know how to stop myself and this was getting out of control, fast. All of this was added in the span of about 3 months.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around;">
                    <img src="Ef4yP53WoAEz0QY.png" style="height:25vh;">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The event system itself was actually suprisingly easy to implement, and served as a great teaching tool. The problem was the UI, I can't even find a screenshot of it and I REALLY don't want to open the Unity project up to see it. Because it looks f****** terrible. For the UI I had to add an "indentation" system to identify the starting- and end-points for each event command. It took about a week of near-constant work to figure it out and it really wasn't worth it. I should have just added a text editor instead and told the player to screw off if it didn't work.
                    <br><br>
                    The straw that broke the camel's back this time however wasn't actually this system though, it wasn't the node-based conversation system I wanted either. It was something I never though I would happen upon. GARBAGE COLLECTION (and terrible memory management). At some point, there had started to be a memory leak in the renderer that I was bragging about before and it continously decreased your framerate from about 532fps to about 12fps... I was SO pissed at this but I dived into the code to figure it out. Honestly though... I couldn't figure it out. I have some ideas about where it could occur but if you wanna find a definite answer you can check out the github linked above but this combined with increasingly difficult subjects at uni made it so that it was difficult to find time to actually sit down and investigate the issue. I do regret that I didn't fix it since I was quite happy with the progress that I did make.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is where Usurper is at the moment. Dead but not yet buried, I still have some hope to be able to see it's bloated corpse walking around some day and perhaps people will even interact with it. The idea for making a toolkit that was born in this fourth iteration is not completely gone however since I have moved the concept to a different engine and made it a lot easier to use. This new thing is called the ROGU Engine and there should soon be a page on it on my projects page.
                    <br>
