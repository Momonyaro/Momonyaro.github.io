# Undernauts or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Grid

So for the recent few weeks I've been playing __Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi__. A grid-based, turn-based RPG that reminds of other similar games, like '__SMT: Strange Journey__' and the '__Etrian Odyssey__' series. However, Undernauts takes the atmosphere of those games to the next level by leveraging the developer's (__Experience inc.__) prior knowledge making horror games to great effect.

I discovered the game from a Youtube video by '_Kougaon_':

After finding the game's concept intriguing enough, I took a shot in the dark and purchased it.

And I don't regret it.

## 1. Atmosphere is King

It's not uncommon for games to start with the character on the verge of dying, but to keep that feeling of tension throughout a 30+ hour game _is_.

Death is not simply a fail-condition where you get a __'GAME OVER'__ with a chance to load the latest save, it's something that is expected and that the player can take advantage of in order to strategize.

This is not something I expected from a game with this dreary premise but wholy embraced as I ventured further into Yomi. Because having a game over is a punishment, time has been wasted, progress erased. It's frustrating.

So what does __Undernauts__ do? It resurrects you back at base, with all party members dead except for your player stand-in. No resources lost, no progress reversed. It's just to resurrect your fallen allies and venture back out.

But how does a game that trivializes death keep a tense atmosphere? Well, by the main antagonist of the game __turning your resurrection machine off__. He does it at the start of the game just as you have found your footing before you manage to turn it back on, meaning that you now realize that respawning is a luxury, and one that can be taken away.

Many times throughout the game as you've finally managed to gather some confidence, it pulls the rug out under you and alters how you think about many of the originally benign design elements. And that's when the game really got its hooks in me.
